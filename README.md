# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (often abbreviated as JS) is a versatile, high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is primarily known as the language of the web, and it plays a crucial role in making web pages interactive and dynamic.

Key aspects of JavaScript:

Client-side scripting: JavaScript is most commonly used for client-side scripting, meaning it runs in a web browser on a user's computer. This allows developers to add interactivity, animations, and other dynamic features to websites without constant communication with the server.
Server-side scripting: Node.js allows JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, enabling developers to build entire web applications using a single language.
Event-driven programming: JavaScript is event-driven, meaning its execution is controlled by events such as user clicks, mouse movements, and form submissions. This allows for responsive and interactive user interfaces.
Cross-platform compatibility: JavaScript runs on a wide variety of platforms, including web browsers, servers (Node.js), and mobile devices (using frameworks like React Native and Ionic).
Object-oriented and functional programming: JavaScript supports both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms, making it flexible and adaptable for various coding styles.
JavaScript's widespread adoption makes it an essential language for web developers and a valuable skill in the tech industry.
